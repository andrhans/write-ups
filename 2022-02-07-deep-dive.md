This challenge file has some secret files hidden deep inside which you might need.

Challenge File: `hacker.docx`

Category: Forensics

Description: This challenge file have some secret files hidden deep inside which you might need.

This is a simple forensic challenge where a word document has to be analyzed. Opening the file shows an extract of a page in Wikipedia.

To start with, this document can be unzipped to find all the files in different folders, depending on the type of file, along with a bunch of `.xml` files with information about the author, and so on.

There are three folders:
* /word
* /_rels
* /docProps

For example, within the `/docProps` folder there are three `.xml` files outlining different properties of the file, such as the number of pages, the amount of words, the amount of characters...

Investigating the `/word` folder shows some other `.xml` files and a `media` directory as well as another `_rels` folder.

Looking through the images is a good idea - The flag is there.
